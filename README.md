Heart disease is increasing rapidly due to number of reasons. If we
predict cardiac arrest (dangerous conditions of heart) in the early stages, it will be
very helpful to cured this disease. Although doctors and health centres collect data
daily, but mostly are not using machine learning and pattern matching techniques
to extract the knowledge that can be very useful in prediction. Bioinformatics is the
real world application of machine learning to extract patterns from the datasets
using several data mining techniques. In this research paper, data and attributes
are taken from the UCI repository. Attribute extraction is very effective in mining
information for the prediction. By utilizing this, various patterns can be derived to
predict the heart disease earlier. Here, I've used Artificial Neural Network to predict possibilities of heart disease based on various health conditions.

Deep Learning is a technology of which mimics a human brain in the sense that it consists of multiple neurons with multiple layers like a human brain. The network so formed consists of an input layer, an output layer, and one or more hidden layers. The network tries to learn from the data that is fed into it and then performs predictions accordingly. The most basic type of neural network is the ANN (Artificial Neural Network). The ANN does not have any special structure, it just comprises of multiple neural layers to be used for prediction.
Letâ€™s build a model that predicts whether a person has heart disease or not by using ANN.

About the data:
In the dataset, we have 13 columns in which we are given different attributes such as sex, age, cholesterol level, etc. and we are given a target column which tells us whether that person has heart disease or not. We will keep all the columns as independent variables other than the target column because it will be our dependent variable. We will build an ANN which will predict whether a person has heart disease or not given other attributes of the person.
